# GIT FETCH

* When you're working on with other collaborators or a github repo.
* One of your teammeat has pushed up the changes to master branch but my local repo doesn't know!
* Then how do I get those changes
* Git fetch and git pull get those changes from github repo to local repo.
* fetching allows us to download changes from remote repo.
* But those changes will not be automatically integrated to our working files.

```git
    git fetch <remote>
    
    <!-- When you want to fetch particular branch -->
    git fetch <remote> <branch>
```
